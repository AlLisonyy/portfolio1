##For this portfolio, I would like to use the dataset from my thesis study.

library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
Thesis <- read_sav("~/Downloads/Thesis.sav")
```

### Step 1: clean data
```{r clean data}
##The first step is to clean data, and I started with getting rid of participants that did not finished the study, as well as deleting variable that does not have any data, such as recipient name.  
Thesis <- Thesis %>% select(-RecipientLastName, -RecipientFirstName, -RecipientEmail, -ExternalReference, -DistributionChannel, -browser_info_Resolution, -StartDate, -EndDate, -browser_info_Browser, -browser_info_Version, -IPAddress, -RecordedDate, -LocationLatitude, -LocationLongitude, -ResponseId, -UserLanguage, -browser_info_Operating_System, -robot_timer_First_Click, -robot_timer_Last_Click, -robot_timer_Page_Submit, -robot_timer_Click_Count)
Thesis <- Thesis[-c(1), ]
##Keep only participants with progress >= 50
Thesis <- Thesis %>% 
  filter(Progress >= 50)
```


```{r scoring scales}
glimpse(Thesis)
```
