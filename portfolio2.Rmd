##For this portfolio, I would like to use the dataset from my thesis study.

library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
Thesis <- Profiles_in_Communications_SONA_February_27_2025_12_57
```

### Step 1: clean data
```{r clean data}
##The first step is to clean data, and I started with getting rid of participants that did not finished the study, as well as deleting variable that does not have any data, such as recipient name.  
Thesis <- Thesis %>% select(-RecipientLastName, -RecipientFirstName, -RecipientEmail, -ExternalReference, -DistributionChannel, -browser_info_Resolution)
Thesis <- Thesis[-c(1), ]
##Keep only participants with progress >= 50
Thesis <- Thesis %>% 
  filter(Progress >= 50)

```
